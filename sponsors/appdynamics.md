The AppDynamics Application Intelligence Platform empowers software-defined businesses to proactively monitor, manage, analyse and optimise the most complex application environments in real time, in production. Using the business transaction as the primary unit of measurement, the platform quickly provides visibility into all user interactions and applications flows, along with real-time business impact and operational insights â€” and the critical ability to identify and resolve issues before users are even aware of them. Self-configuring, self-learning, and massively scalable, the platform is rapidly deployed on-premises, via SaaS, or as a hybrid. The AppDynamics Application Intelligence Platform enables you to anticipate problems, resolve them automatically, and make smarter, more certain business decisions.
