## Using Continuous Delivery to Build Products Customers Actually Use
{: #usingcd}

#### Keynote

######[Jan Bosch]({{site.root}}/speakers#jbosch), Chalmers University of Technology

Research shows that for a typical system, more than half of all the features are never used. This is a colossal waste of R&D effort and is caused by companies asking customers and users what they want. Users don't know what they want and it's the engineer's job to find out. The presentation shows how Continuous Delivery can address this challenge by providing a systematic approach to exploring a broad set of hypotheses about functionality that might add value for users at different stages of development. The presentation introduces the notion of Innovation Experiment Systems as a systematic method for optimizing the user experience of existing features, developing new features as well as developing new products. Continuous Delivery is discussed as it provides the core enabling technology for successfully implementing this approach. The presentation is based on data from eight industrial cases and stresses the importance of speed and rapid iterations in development. The presentation uses numerous examples from industry are used to illustrate the concepts.

## Continuous Delivery Maturity

######[Lars Kruse]({{site.root}}/speakers#lkruse), Praqma

For most software development teams it is a major challenge keeping up with the rapidly changing requirements, while delivering quality software within budget and deadlines. Implementing Agile or Lean methods is a step in the right direction, but many teams find out that this doesn't really solve the problems. This presentation give a comprehensive introduction to the multifaceted landscape of Continuous Delivery, argue why it is an important part of the solution, and present some successful real-life implementations of a full Continuous Delivery automation. Based on Praqma's CD maturity model the presentation will demonstrate how the ability to continuously deliver working software requires a certain level of maturity in software development processes.

## Peer reviews are for sissies

Peer reviews are not a silver bullet. They often introduce validation in the QA process at a time where verification is really what's needed. Peer reviews represent unplanned work as well as queued work processes. The alternative: to automate your Continuous Delivery pipeline to an extend where you actually trust it to implement your definition of done - now that's lean!

## Game changing beliefs

######[Morten Elvang]({{site.root}}/speakers#elvang), DELTA

How can you create an organization where it's possible to have success with CoDe and devops? Imagine you can chose to believe in something and that choosing the right things can fundamentally change your luck in business? Is this at all a useful way to go about creating an effective and supportive organization? And, if so, what should you chose to believe in?

## DevOps and Moving the Elephant

######[Chris Gargiulo]({{site.root}}/speakers#gargiulo), Maersk Group Infrastructure Services

Introducing DevOps as a methodology for delivering business value into an existing organization has many challanges. One of the largest being that of going against long established norms and processes. In the presentation, 'DevOps and Moving the Elephant', I will present a brief history of the progress made within Maersk Line IT and now Maersk Group IS that have helped make the difference in being able to anchor critical changes in how IT infrastructure is delivered and managed using DevOps methods.

## On the way towards the vision of DevOps

######[Per Arnold Blaasmo]({{site.root}}/speakers#blaasmo), Atmel Norway

A talk about the challenges and experiences for Atmel when moving from a Waterfall model to a DevOps model with Continuous Deployment, when doing software development in a global company.

## Making the Case for Review
{: #making}

######[Austin Bingham]({{site.root}}/speakers#bingham), Sixty North AS

Reviews are a powerful tool for building quality software, but it can sometimes be difficult to convince your team to use them. In this presentation we’ll look at the research behind reviews, the benefits they can provide, and some best practices for using them effectively. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to make informed decisions about - and strong arguments for - using reviews on your projects.
