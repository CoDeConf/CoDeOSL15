## Using Continuous Delivery to Build Products Customers Actually Use
{: #usingcd}

#### Keynote

######[Jan Bosch]({{site.root}}/speakers#jbosch), Chalmers University of Technology

Research shows that for a typical system, more than half of all the features are never used. This is a colossal waste of R&D effort and is caused by companies asking customers and users what they want. Users don't know what they want and it's the engineer's job to find out. The presentation shows how Continuous Delivery can address this challenge by providing a systematic approach to exploring a broad set of hypotheses about functionality that might add value for users at different stages of development. The presentation introduces the notion of Innovation Experiment Systems as a systematic method for optimizing the user experience of existing features, developing new features as well as developing new products. Continuous Delivery is discussed as it provides the core enabling technology for successfully implementing this approach. The presentation is based on data from eight industrial cases and stresses the importance of speed and rapid iterations in development. The presentation uses numerous examples from industry are used to illustrate the concepts.

## Feedback-driven Product Development
{: #feedback}

######[Olve Maudal]({{site.root}}/speakers#omaudal), Cisco

Cisco's development and innovation centre in Norway develops videoconferencing products, telepresence technology and collaboration solutions. This is embedded product development involving advanced mechanics, customised electronics, movable parts and millions of lines of software mostly written in C and C++. Over the last two decades we have gradually established a workflow that very much supports lean and agile product development for hundreds of engineers working closely together. A lot of effort goes into establishing effective feedback loops guiding the whole development process. We are not only talking about rapid feedback from build systems and Continuous Integration, but also from regression tests, advanced scenario testing and real users. The focus on establishing feedback loops goes beyond the product development workflow, it is a principle applicable to the whole organization. This talk will present a concrete insight into the software development workflow that we are
using today, before discussing what you need to consider if you want to set up an equally effective feedback-driven product development workflow in your organization.

## Estimates and Continuous Delivery
{: #estimates}

######[Seb Rose]({{site.root}}/speakers#srose), Consultant & Coach

Estimates are slippery things at the best of times, but they get a whole lot more slippery when combined with Continuous Delivery. In this session we discover that there is more than one kind of estimate and examine how they are typically used in an agile context. We'll then dig a bit deeper to see how Continuous Delivery affects our approach, and whether there are any responsible alternatives to estimation. Along the way I hope to play a game or two with you, so be prepared to have some fun with estimates.

## All unicorns were once horses (and some were donkeys before that)
{: #unicorns}

######[Mike Long]({{site.root}}/speakers#mlong), Praqma Norway

One of the most widely held beliefs about DevOps is that it applies "only for startups and unicorns". We think of all the success stories from Google, Amazon, Etsy, and Flickr and conclude that all the best-in-class companies were born as "unicorns", with DevOps in their DNA. However, when we look at the paths these companies have forged a different story emerges. A story of ambition, commitment, and determination to overcome real and difficult barriers in technology and culture. The truth is that all unicorns were once horses - and some were  donkeys before that. This presentation will bust common myths about Continuous Delivery and look at what it  takes to transform a donkey to a market-leading unicorn.

## DevOps and Moving the Elephant
{: #elephant}

######[Chris Gargiulo]({{site.root}}/speakers#cgargiulo), Maersk Group

Introducing DevOps as a methodology for delivering business value into an existing organization has many challanges. One of the largest being that of going against long established norms and processes. In the presentation, ‘DevOps and Moving the Elephant’, I will present a brief history of the progress made within Maersk Line IT and now Maersk Group IS that has helped make the difference in being able to anchor critical changes in how IT infrastructure is delivered and managed using DevOps methods.

## Game Changing Beliefs
{: #gamechanging}

######[Morten Elvang]({{site.root}}/speakers#elvang), DELTA

How can you create an organization where it's possible to have success with CoDe and DevOps? Imagine you can chose to believe in something and that choosing the right things can fundamentally change your luck in business? Is this at all a useful way to go about creating an effective and supportive organization? And, if so, what should you chose to believe in?

## Operational Excellence in Multi-disciplinary Product Development
{: #execellence}

######[Dag Arne Brænd]({{site.root}}/speakers#dbrænd), Novelda

Answering the following questions from an industrial point of view: How do you develop, control, and maintain an advanced SW codebase that distributes and ships into multiple HW products? How does Continuous Delivery of SW fit into such an environment? How do you set-up a SW quality toolchain that starts with design and ends up in a product at the customers desk?

## On the way towards the vision of DevOps
{: #vision}

######[Per Arnold Blaasmo]({{site.root}}/speakers#pblaasmo), Atmel

A talk about the challenges and experiences for Atmel when moving from a Waterfall model to a DevOps model with Continuous Deployment, when doing software development in a global company.

## What does Continuous Delivery demand of me as a person?
{: #demand}

######[Mark Coleman]({{site.root}}/speakers#mcoleman), Implicit- Explicit

Anyone looking to learn more about Continuous Delivery can find reams of information; from tooling to organisational design, it seems that all topics are covered by an ever growing  amount of information in books and online. Over the last 5 years I've introduced Continuous Delivery to several teams, and in every single project, the biggest hurdle to be overcome is not one of insufficient knowledge, but one of personality. Quite simply, if your team were already mature enough to implement Continuous Delivery, and if Continuous Delivery were the solution to a problem they were facing, they would have already implemented it. If you're struggling to implement Continuous Delivery then, that can only tell you one of two things: 1. Your team is not mature enough. 2. Continuous Delivery is not the solution to your problem.
In this talk we will assume that Continuous Delivery is the solution to your problem and will discover through various stories, which character traits should be present in your team members if they are to build and deliver cutting edge software. We will conclude with suggestions on how to build such a team. This is a non-technical talk for anyone who is managing, or is a member of, a team who are trying to implement Continuous Delivery.

## Making the Case for Review
{: #making}

######[Austin Bingham]({{site.root}}/speakers#bingham), Sixty North AS

Reviews are a powerful tool for building quality software, but it can sometimes be difficult to convince your team to use them. In this presentation we’ll look at the research behind reviews, the benefits they can provide, and some best practices for using them effectively. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll be able to make informed decisions about - and strong arguments for - using reviews on your projects.

## Continuous Deployment to large scale embedded systems
{: #largescale}

######[Tore Martin Hagen]({{site.root}}/speakers#thagen), WesternGeco

The Nessi6 is Schulmbergers largest project ever. The embedded SW part has ran for 10 years with a team of up to 10 people. In this talk we will hear about how the use of Continuous Delivery and automatic HW testing have enabled this large project.
