## CoDeOSL15 Post Conference Blogpost

The Continuous Delivery & DevOps Conference has now also been to Oslo. On April 29th 2015 we decided to repeat the success of the Continuous Delivery and DevOps Conference that was held for the first time in Copenhagen in 2014. 150 attendees gathered in Oslo to gain insight on the current trends of Continuous Delivery & DevOps. The conference was organized by Praqma together with co-host CA Technologies and XebiaLabs, Delphix, Bekk, AppDynamics, and DevOps Norway as participating sponsors.

#### CoDeOSL 2015

With two parallel tracks the program was designed so that the keynote speakers took the main stage in front of all attendees and presentations were run on two tracks, giving attendees the freedom to pick and choose the presentations of interest. The program ended with a final panel discussion, where the entire speaker roster took stage to elaborate on their statements as well as allowing attendees to get any questions arisen through the day answered.

#### The need for Continuous Delivery
Throughout the day, speakers shared different perspectives on topics closely related to Continuous Delivery and DevOps. Some had a more theoretical approach while others presented “tales from the trenches” approaching both the different organizational as well as technical challenges in global corporations as well as smaller setups. However, common for all was the increasing need for Continuous Delivery and DevOps.

#### So why do we need continuous delivery and DevOps?
With his closing keynote speak “Using Continuous Delivery to Build Products Customers Actually Use” Jan Bosch sought to answer this question making two interesting main points; (1) Customers do not know what they want and (2) all products will eventually become services.
His point; since customers don’t know what’s possible, they do not know what they want. Thus, one can’t simply ask a large group of people what they want and then make it. Customers will know once they see it - this requires “Need for Speed” (as Bosch put it). This means Continuous Development of product, which he also argues requires DevOps. Bosch’ second point stated that all products will eventually become services, just like many software systems are today. This will require a setup that allows products to be continuously developed throughout its lifetime.

Although the concept Continuous Delivery tends to be somewhat clear, the way companies implement, utilise, and to some extend benefit from it, still differs. While some companies represented at the conference had already implemented and benefited from the use of Continuous Delivery other companies were still not reaping the benefits or hadn’t even started implementing the Continuous Delivery mindset.
